# Control Datasets

This folder describes lightweight control datasets for validating OCR and reconstruction quality. 
Store non-sensitive sample images in your object storage bucket and refer to them in `controls.json`.

- Include a representative mix of:
  - Clean printed pages
  - Scanned documents
  - Photos with perspective/lighting issues
  - Lists, headings, tables
  - Multilingual samples

Note: Do not include vendor/model names in user-visible documentation or UI.
